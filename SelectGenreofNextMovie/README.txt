Exercise

We’re interested in seeing how you work with a small data set in order to generate a recommendation based on your analytics. We’re asking people to return this within a few business days to keep the process moving, but please don’t spend the entire time working on this (we expect it to take 1 hour or less).

When writing up your results, please limit your response to a few pages/slides (including graphs, if necessary), and make sure to submit any files or code to Greenhouse along with the write-up so we can see how you worked through the problem.

If you have any questions, please e-mail justin.berka@intercom.io

Imagine you are an executive producer at a movie studio, and are tasked with picking the genre of your studio’s next movie. Using the data in the included file, which genre would you recommend, and why?

# Chicago_taxi_trips

This project is an exploratory data analysis on Chicago taxi trips, which explores the variables, structure, patterns, oddities, 
and underlying relationships of the dataset. The analysis is almost like a stream-of-consciousness as we ask questions, 
create visualizations, and explore the data.

## What included:
* The RMD file containing the analysis (final plots and summary, and reflection)
* the HTML file knitted from the RMD file using the knitr package
* the data set used
